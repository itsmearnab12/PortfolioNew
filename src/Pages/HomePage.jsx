                    Hi, I’m a third-year student at Parul University, pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications. I have a strong interest in development and data, and I believe in learning by building, problem-solving, and creating solutions for real-world challenges.
                    Currently, I’m strengthening my development skills by building projects using React.js, Express.js, and Node.js, while also solidifying my core foundation in data analytics.
